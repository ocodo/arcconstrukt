Notes on the Instruction Overlays:

Press the Title Bar (says: ArcConstrukt ) to view Instructions
Overlays Each toolbar mode has a separate overlay, they will be
displayed automatically the first time the user selects a toolbar
mode.

To select each mode, press the selector at the bottom right, each one
is a different tool mode. From left to right:

    Edit  |   Color  |   Order

==========================================================================================

Not all text is for the Instructions overlay, many of these
translations are for Buttons and messages spread throughout the
Application, if you want to locate an item in the App, for example, to
see context, contact Jason if you can't find it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on text length / size
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All text is expected to remain a similar length, however this may not
be possible in some circumstances.

Ideally, figure out all text translations first, and try to maintain
same length, if you cannot, please make a note next to the translation
like so:

"English original text" = "Texto original en Inglés" //LONG

^ This translation is longer than the original, so "//LONG" is placed
after it, always just use "//LONG". Jason will be in touch if
necessary.
