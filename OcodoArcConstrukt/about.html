            ArcConstrukt is a hybrid graphic editor, it's sole purpose is the
            construction of ArcMachines. What are ArcMachines? Awesome is what they are!
            </p>
            <h4>Getting started</h4>
            <p class="about-text">
            You create each Arc in your composition with the <strong>+</strong> button, and can delete
            them with the trash button. The active arc is red, get it's real colour back with the <strong>X</strong> button. Navigate through the layers with the up
            <img src="up.png"/> and down <img src="down.png"/> controls.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
            To change the colour and transparency of an Arc segment, just [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] and choose the fill or
            outline colour.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
            In the tool kit you have one finger rotational control to change the start <img src="start.png"/> and end <img src="end.png"/> angles
            of an arc.
            
            Pinch and expand gestures to change the radius <img src="radius.png"/>, or the thickness <img src="thickness.png"/>. Both these
            touch controls have locks <img src="padlock.png"/>, so that you don't change something you don't want to.
            There's also a wide range of grid overlays to help you out (radial and cartesian).
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
            When you're happy with a design, click the camera button and it'll save a
            1920x1920 image into your Camera Roll with a transparent background, perfect for
            incorporating into your edits.
